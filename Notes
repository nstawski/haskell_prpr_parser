1. Issues with installing packages, megaparsec and parsec. Installed xcode-tools, didn't help. Tried using Cabal repl, still didn't help.




• Couldn't match type ‘Text’ with ‘[Char]’
      Expected: Tokens Text
        Actual: String


This error message indicates that the string function is expecting Text but is receiving a String ([Char]).

From Megaparsec 7 onwards, the string function from Text.Megaparsec.Char operates on Text rather than [Char]. If you are using a literal string like "PLATE", it's interpreted as a list of characters (i.e., String), not Text.

If you want to continue using Text, you need to use the OverloadedStrings language extension, which allows string literals to be interpreted as other string-like types, including Text.
